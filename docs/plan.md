# Bibcheck Web Interface - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Goal

Create a user-friendly web interface that provides the same powerful BibTeX validation and completion capabilities as the existing Python command-line tool, making the functionality accessible to users who prefer graphical interfaces while maintaining full compatibility with the existing system.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Command-line BibTeX validation tool with DOI fetching, arXiv ID resolution, and intelligent field comparison
- Technology stack: Python 3.x, bibtexparser, requests, argparse
- Integration points: DOI.org API, arXiv API, local file processing

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: React-based web interface with Material-UI components
- How it integrates: Standalone web application that replicates Python functionality, no changes to existing Python tool
- Success criteria: Web interface successfully processes BibTeX files and provides same validation results as Python tool

## Stories

1. **Frontend Foundation**: Set up React application with Material-UI, create basic layout and file upload functionality
2. **BibTeX Processing**: Implement BibTeX parsing and validation logic in JavaScript, replicate Python comparison algorithms
3. **API Integration**: Connect to DOI and arXiv APIs, implement same intelligent fetching logic as Python version

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (DOI.org, arXiv APIs)
- [x] No database schema changes (file-based processing only)
- [x] UI follows Material Design patterns (new interface, no existing UI to conflict)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (web interface doesn't affect Python tool)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Web interface might not replicate all Python functionality accurately
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive unit tests comparing web results to Python tool outputs
- **Rollback Plan:** If issues found, can disable web interface while keeping Python tool fully functional

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing (Python tool remains unchanged)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (file processing, API calls)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (README for web interface)
- [x] No regression in existing features (Python tool unaffected)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Python 3.x with bibtexparser and requests
- Integration points: DOI.org API, arXiv API, local file processing
- Existing patterns to follow: Intelligent field comparison, DOI fetching, arXiv ID resolution
- Critical compatibility requirements: Web interface must produce identical results to Python tool
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a user-friendly web interface for the bibcheck functionality."
