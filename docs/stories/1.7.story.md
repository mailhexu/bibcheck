# Story 1.7 - Individual Entry Actions: Per-Card Fetch & Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story Statement
As a user, I want individual buttons on each BibTeX entry card to fetch missing fields and validate data for that specific entry, so that I can work on entries selectively without processing all entries at once.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each BibTeX entry card has a "Fetch Missing Fields" button
- Each BibTeX entry card has a "Validate Entry" button
- Individual fetch operations update only the selected entry
- Individual validation shows results only for the selected entry
- Buttons are disabled during processing with loading indicators
- Real-time updates show progress for individual entry operations
- Operations can run concurrently on different entries

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Global fetch functionality already implemented
- Individual entry UI components established
- Real-time progress tracking working
- API integration supports selective operations

**Data Models:**
- Individual entry processing state
- Per-entry loading indicators
- Selective validation results

**Component Specifications:**
- EntryActionButtons component: Fetch and validate buttons per entry
- Individual progress indicators
- Selective API calls for single entries

**File Locations:**
- `src/components/features/EntryActions/EntryActions.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useApiIntegration.ts` (extend for single entry operations)
- `src/components/features/BibTeXEditor/BibTeXEditor.tsx` (add action buttons)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for individual entry operations
- Integration tests for concurrent operations
- UI tests for button states and loading indicators

**Technical Constraints:**
- Support concurrent operations on multiple entries
- Maintain existing global operation functionality
- Proper error handling for individual failures
- Performance considerations for multiple simultaneous API calls

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. Create EntryActions component with fetch and validate buttons
2. Extend API integration hook for single entry operations
3. Add individual loading states and progress indicators
4. Integrate action buttons into BibTeXEditor
5. Handle concurrent operations and state management
6. Write unit and integration tests
