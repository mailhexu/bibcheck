# Story 1.2 - BibTeX Processing: Parsing and Validation Logic

## Status
Draft

## Story Statement
As a user, I want the web interface to parse uploaded BibTeX files and validate their entries, so I can identify missing or incorrect fields and improve the quality of my bibliographic data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Uploaded `.bib` files are parsed into structured data in the browser
- Each BibTeX entry is displayed in a readable format
- Validation logic checks for missing fields (title, author, journal, year, volume, number, pages, doi)
- Validation results are shown for each entry, highlighting missing or inconsistent data
- UI allows users to review validation results and prepare for corrections
- All validation logic matches the Python bibcheck tool's behavior

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** 
- File upload and parsing trigger implemented in Story 1.1
- Main layout and Material-UI integration complete

**Data Models:** 
- BibTeX entry structure: key-value pairs for standard fields
- Validation result model: entry ID, list of missing/incorrect fields, suggested corrections
[Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#component-standards]

**API Specifications:** 
- No external API calls required for this story (local validation only)

**Component Specifications:** 
- BibTeXEditor component: Displays parsed entries, highlights validation results
- ValidationResults component: Summarizes issues per entry
[Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#component-standards]

**File Locations:** 
- `src/components/features/BibTeXEditor/BibTeXEditor.tsx`
- `src/components/features/ValidationResults/ValidationResults.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useBibTeXParser.ts`
- `src/hooks/useValidation.ts`
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Testing Requirements:** 
- Unit tests for BibTeX parsing logic
- Unit tests for validation logic (field checks, error highlighting)
- Integration test for file upload to validation flow
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Technical Constraints:** 
- Validation logic must match Python bibcheck tool's rules
- Use TypeScript for all new code

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. Implement BibTeX parsing logic in `useBibTeXParser` hook [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
2. Create BibTeXEditor component to display parsed entries [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
3. Implement validation logic in `useValidation` hook [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
4. Create ValidationResults component to show issues per entry [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md]
5. Integrate validation flow with file upload [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
6. Write unit and integration tests for parsing and validation [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Project Structure Notes
All components and files should follow the structure defined in `architecture/source-tree.md`. No conflicts identified.
