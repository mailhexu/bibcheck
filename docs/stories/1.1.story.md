# Story 1.1 - Frontend Foundation: React App Setup and File Upload

## Status
Draft

## Story Statement
As a user, I want to access a web interface for bibcheck so that I can upload BibTeX files and begin validating entries without using the command-line tool.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new React application is created using Create React App
- Material-UI is integrated for UI components and theming
- The main layout includes a file upload component for BibTeX files
- Uploaded files are parsed and prepared for validation (no validation logic yet)
- The UI is responsive and follows Material Design guidelines
- The application is documented in the README
